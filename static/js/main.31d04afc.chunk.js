I was fourteen, small, thin as a thread, and I walked. Always beside me was Rosa with Magda, who lived in a warm cocoon nestled against Rosa\u2019s breasts. On and on, we marched down the road bounded by freshly dug ditches. At every step, icy claws pierced through the soles of my worn-down shoes, sinking an unyielding chill into my bones. I envied the baby Magda: wrapped in the shawl, swathed in Rosa\u2019s existence, shielded from the drapes of smoke and snowing ash. Hunger gnawed a bottomless hole within me. I never shared my food and Rosa never shared with me. An insatiable dagger had plunged itself into my stomach, leaving me permanently starving. My growth had all but come to a standstill; even at fourteen, I still had not menstruated. Magda had drunk Rosa dry, only a drop was left of her. She no longer menstruated and rarely ate, giving most of her food to Magda. She was chronically in a trance, a mother reduced to a shell with room only for Magda."]})]})},j=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"nav-scroll",children:[Object(d.jsx)("h4",{id:"#/contact",children:"Contact"}),Object(d.jsxs)("p",{id:"#/contact",className:"nav-scroll",children:[Object(d.jsx)(c.a,{style:{color:"pink"}}),"My existence consisted of walking and standing, perpetual hunger and cold; silent Magda existed in the hidden refuge of the shawl. Fires always kept the barracks cold. Nothing more than a collection of cold bones wrapped in tired skin, an isolated child in need of care, I slowly dwindled away. In one moment, the shawl whispered promises into my ears. Hugging my body, it wrapped its cocoon of warmth around me and lulled me to sleep. An animal backed into a corner, Rosa howled and tore away the warmth embracing my sleep. In a heavy-eyed haze, I watched her disappear into the square with the shawl flying around her. In one moment, Magda died, and all warmth vanished. The shawl had been Magda and now Magda was the shawl. Thrust back into the coldness, I watched Rosa devour each thread of the shawl."]})]})},b=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"nav-scroll",children:[Object(d.jsx)("h4",{id:"#/projects",children:"Projects"}),Object(d.jsxs)("p",{id:"#/projects",className:"nav-scroll",children:[Object(d.jsx)(c.a,{style:{color:"turquoise"}}),"Threads of Magda interweaved with the shawl\u2019s and the shawl gave her life. The shawl had many identities: a protective home, a cloak of warmth, a baby, a pet, a little sister. An entity that no person except she and Rosa could touch. After Rosa\u2019s milk had vanished, the shawl nourished Magda. I would watch as she satiated her hunger by suckling the milk of linen out of its corners, absorbing its essence. Allowed only to peer in, I was an outsider to the bubble that was Rosa, Magda and the shawl. An outsider that could observe how Magda\u2019s roundness with eyes blue as air and hair of yellow starlight contrasted against Rosa\u2019s bleak, dark like cholera, complexion. Dragging one heavy step after another, I would study the blueness hidden in the warmth of the shawl. \u201cAryan\u201d entered my mind during moments when, through the shroud of the shawl, the blue eyes caught mine. Once, when I was so exhausted, \u201cAryan\u201d escaped my mind, flew from my lips, and penetrated the air. Rosa looked at me as if I was a predator ready to feast on its prey; I slunk further within myself."]})]})},m=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)(l.d,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(l.b,{path:["/devonlayton/aboutme","#/aboutme"],exact:!0,component:h}),Object(d.jsx)(l.b,{path:["/devonlayton/projects","#/projects"],exact:!0,component:b}),Object(d.jsx)(l.b,{path:["/devonlayton/contact","#/contact"],exact:!0,component:j}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{to:"/devonlayton"})]})},u=(t(26),t(54)),w=t(55),p=t(49),y=t.p+"static/media/customLogo512.3c667592.png",g=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(u.a,{id:"site-nav",expand:"md",variant:"dark",children:Object(d.jsx)(u.a.Collapse,{children:Object(d.jsxs)(w.a,{className:"justify-content-right",variant:"pills",id:"site-nav",as:"ul",children:[Object(d.jsxs)(w.a.Link,{className:"Nav-link",href:"/devonlayton",style:{color:"hotpink"},children:[Object(d.jsx)(p.a,{src:y,className:"App-logo",alt:"logo"})," "]}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{href:"/devonlayton",children:"Devon Layton"}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{href:"/devonlayton/aboutme",children:"About Me"}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{href:"/devonlayton/projects",children:"Projects"}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{href:"/devonlayton/contact",children:"Contact"})]})})})},f=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)("div",{className:"nav-scroll","data-bs-spy":"scroll","data-bs-target":"#site-nav","data-bs-offset":"0",tabIndex:0,children:Object(d.jsx)(g,{})})})},x=t(50),v=t(51),O=t(52),k=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)(w.a,{className:"justify-content-center ",variant:"pills",as:"ul",children:[Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Item,{className:"Nav-link",children:Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{className:"Nav-link",as:"span",children:Object(d.jsx)(x.a,{})})}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Item,{children:Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{className:"Nav-link",href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonlayton017/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:Object(d.jsx)(v.a,{})})}),Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Item,{children:Object(d.jsx)(w.a.Link,{className:"Nav-link",href:"https://github.com/Dml4h",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:Object(d.jsx)(O.a,{})})})]})};var I=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(d.jsxs)(i.a,{className:"appContainer",children:[Object(d.jsx)(f,{}),Object(d.jsx)(m,{})]}),Object(d.jsx)(k,{})]})},N=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&t.e(3).then(t.bind(null,56)).then((function(a){var t=a.getCLS,n=a.getFID,s=a.getFCP,o=a.getLCP,r=a.getTTFB;t(e),n(e),s(e),o(e),r(e)}))},M=t(21);t(45);r.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(s.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(M.a,{children:Object(d.jsx)(I,{})})}),document.getElementById("root")),N()}},[[46,1,2]]]);
